DESCRIPTION:

This module contains routines for converting a vxWorks global variable
name into its address. The old approach of extracting the variable name
from the record name is no longer supported.

The supplied link field must be of type INST_IO, and its string value is
assumed to be of the form:

   [ "*" ] name [ "[" index "]" ]

where quoted items are literal and square brackets imply optional
items.  White space is ignored. The leading "*", if specified,
implies that the variable in question contains the address of the
desired data. The name is the name of the vxWorks global variable
(a leading underscore will be added if required by the particular
target architecture). The optional array index is multipled by the
data element size (e.g. sizeof(char), sizeof(long) or
sizeof(double)) and applied as an offset to the data address.

For example:

  a) "fred" refers to the value of the vxWorks global variable "fred"

  b) "*fred" refers to the value whose address is the value of the
     vxWorks global variable "fred"

  c) "fred[1]" assumes that the vxWorks global variable "fred" is an
     array and refers to its second element

  d) "*fred[1]" assumes that the vxWorks global variable "fred"
     contains the address of an array and refers to the second element
     of the array

Note that the interpretation of the "*" operator is not the same as
in C.  For example, "fred" and "fred[0]" are the same and "*fred" and
"fred[0]" are not the same.  In this version of the driver, the 
value of the pointer is read at run-time rather than initialisation.

Finally note that strings are not treated any differently from longs
or doubles in that the address returned from this routine is simply
the address of the data. "fred" is the entire string. "fred[2]"
starts at the third character of the string.
